## Overview

Scroll Souls is a gamified emotional journaling app that helps you track how you feel every day and reflect on your emotions. The goal is to make emotional awareness fun, insightful, and safe.

Users can log eight core emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Stress/Overwhelm, Peace/Calm, Love/Affection, and Tired/Drained. For each emotion, you can write a note about why you feel that way, or just track it quickly. This helps you notice patterns in your moods over time.

The app features a global emotion wrap that shows how the world is feeling today. You can see trends in emotions across all users, giving a sense of connection while keeping everyone anonymous.

Users are part of organizations or teams, where they can post anonymously. Only the team sees their posts, and no one outside the organization can access them. Admins get insights through aggregated analytics, helping them understand the overall emotional health of their team without seeing anyone’s personal details.

Gamification is a core part of Scroll Souls. Logging emotions earns points, unlocking badges and achievements that encourage consistent tracking and reflection. This makes emotional journaling more engaging and rewarding.

Privacy-first with Web ZK: Scroll Souls already uses Web Zero-Knowledge proofs to ensure anonymity. Users can post within their teams or on the global mood wall without revealing their identities, while admins can access aggregate insights safely. This system guarantees that sensitive emotional data stays private while still providing meaningful analytics.

Scroll Souls is perfect for anyone who wants to understand themselves better, reflect on their feelings, and connect safely with a community while keeping their emotions private.
